# z88dk-ext
Extra External programs

Contributions (via pull requests) are welcome, given that:
* Applications are compilable or assembleable through zcc and use z88dk libraries where possible and relevant.
* Applications should have example zcc incantations in comments in the source, or in a separate readme, to make the chance of success close to 100%.
* There needs to be a licence file or licence header associated with each application.

NOTE FOR LINUX/xBSD DISTRIBUTION MAINTAINERS:  This repository should be put in packages marked as "non-free", please verify the single file headers for details!
