This is an abstract of the CP/M commands written in C for the Olivetti M20.
It probably was a joint effort of Digital Research and Zilog to overcome the lack of a PL/M compiler for the Zilog Z8001 CPU.
The commands were written with the portability in mind, thus we are trying to backport them to cp/m 80.
