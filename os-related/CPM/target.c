    ====================================


    This is a short submit program.  It is designed to be used 
    when the user wants to batch a few commands, but it's too 
    much trouble to edit a SUB file to do the work.  It can be 
    used in two forms:

	B>TARGET ;command line 1 ;command line 2 ; ... command line n

    or (** the -DINTERACTIVE option is still NOT WORKING **)

	B>TARGET
	}command 1
	}command 2
	 .
	 .
	}command n
	}

    In the first form, the TARGET command is entered with arguments.
    group of characters delimited by a semicolon (or the end of
    the line) is treated as a separate command.

    In the second form, TARGET is entered without arguments.  
    TARGET then prompts with a "}", and the user enters commands, one
    per line.  A null line terminates command entry.
    (To enter a null line, enter a singe ^ on the line.)

    In either form, control characters can be entered either
    directly or via a sequence beginning with a "^" and followed
    by a letter or one of [\]^_
